Keyboard shortcuts can be used for controlling most aspects of Transcribe!'s operation. There are some standard shortcuts listed on the menus such as F1 for Help, control-O for Open, and these cannot be changed. However most other keystrokes are available for use as shortcuts if you want, and you can configure them to do what you want.<P>

These configurable shortcuts do not at present appear alongside menu items even when there is a corresponding menu item - for instance "Fit whole file" is a menu command which also happens to have a keyboard shortcut configured by default (see below) but you won't see the shortcut mentioned on the menu itself.<P>

Depending on how your computer is set up, various keystroke combinations may be "grabbed" by the operating system before Transcribe! sees them, for instance alt-tab usually switches between windows. Such combinations cannot be used for Transcribe! shortcuts, but this should not be a problem as there are plenty more you can use.<P>


Keyboards and their drivers are in fact a very quirky area what with different language layouts, hot keys, OEM-specific extra keys and so on. So you may find that some key combinations may not show up at all in the "Type a key" box (see below) in which case you can't use them as shortcuts in Transcribe!, or they may show up wrongly - either the key itself or the modifiers used may be reported incorrectly - in which case you can use them despite being named incorrectly. If it's a problem, just use a different keystroke for your shortcut.<P>

On Windows, Transcribe! will not respond to Ctrl-Numpad keys when NumLock is on, but you lose nothing here because Ctrl-NumLock-Numpad0 (for instance) is anyway the same as Ctrl-Shift-Numpad0 which <i>does</i> work in Transcribe!. Also you should avoid Alt-Numpad combinations as Windows uses these for generating special characters.<p>

These shortcuts only work when one of your transcription windows is active, because other windows may want the keystrokes themselves. If you have been adjusting something in the Audio Effects and Controls window, for instance, then the keyboard shortcuts listed here won't work. All you have to do, though, is press the Escape key which will take you back to the transcription window where shortcuts have their usual effect. If you are working with video then shortcuts <i>do</i> work in the video window. See also the section about Global Shortcuts, below.<P>

Transcribe! has various keyboard shortcuts configured by default, here is a list of them. If you press the Default button in the Keyboard Shortcuts dialog then these shortcuts will be restored, but additional shortcuts you have defined will not be deleted. <B>Please Note</B> that some new default shortcuts may appear in this list from time to time with new Transcribe! releases. Transcribe! will not automatically load these in case they overwrite shortcuts defined by you. So press the Default button if you want to be sure of having all the shortcuts listed here.<P>

<H3>Configuring Keyboard Shortcuts</H3>
As already mentioned, the above list shows the default configuration but you can change it with the Keyboard Shortcuts dialog.<P>

Transcribe! has hundreds of commands which can be triggered by a keystroke if you want. Each command has a unique name which is fairly short and uses mixed case and no spaces, for instance "PlayPauseOn" pauses playback and "RecentFile7" loads the seventh file on the Recent Files list. You can <A HREF="cmnddoc.htm">find a complete list here.</A><P>

The list box at the top of the dialog shows all currently configured shortcuts. The first column shows the keystroke, the second column shows the name of the command to trigger when the key is pressed, the third column shows the name of the command to trigger when the key is released (if any). You can click on any line to display its details in the "Shortcut Details" box, and this is where you can change its function if you want.<P>

To create a new shortcut, first click on the "Type a key" box, then type the key you want to define a shortcut for. Its description should appear in the box. Then press the "Create or Edit shortcut" button. If there was already a shortcut for this keystroke then it will show it to you. Otherwise it will create a new one, with no commands yet defined for it. Press either of the "Select" buttons to specify a command for pressing and/or releasing this keystroke.<P>

You can make a single keystroke do two things by doing one on press, the other on release. If you want a single keystroke to recall a stored loop position and start playback then set its "press" command to e.g. "LoopRecall6" and its "release" command to "PlaySelectionStart".
Or to select a whole measure around the current point set its "press" command to "SelectionIncreaseRightMeasure" and its "release" command to "SelectionIncreaseLeftMeasure".
Then to advance the selection to the next whole measure, program another key with its "press" command to "SelectionIncreaseRightMeasure" and its "release" command to "SelectionDecreaseLeftMeasure".
This is just to give you an idea of the sort of thing you can do.<P>

<B>The "Select Command" Dialog</B><P>
This shows a list of the commands available so you can select one (or "none" at the top of the list). They are divided into categories so you should click one of the radio buttons to display the commands in that category. If the currently selected command does not belong to the selected category then the currently selected command will be added to the list anyway so you can see it, just below the "none" entry.<P>

Click on any of these and a description of its action appears below the listbox. You can <A HREF="cmnddoc.htm">find a complete list here.</A>  Of course, many of them correspond to commands you already know about if you are familiar with Transcribe! : commands found on the menus and toolbar.<P>

<HR>
<H3>Global Shortcuts</H3>

You can create "global" shortcuts as well as the normal kind. That means shortcuts which remain active even when Transcribe! is not the active application. So you could be entering notes into a music notation package, or typing text into a word processor, and you might not even be able to see Transcribe! at all - but you can still control Transcribe!'s playback with global shortcuts. It is also possible to control Transcribe! with pedals when in the background. If you want Transcribe! to play when in the background, you must turn on Preferences - Playback - Keep playing when in background.<P>

Of course, you should use global shortcuts very sparingly because those keystrokes then become unavailable to other applications. It's best to stick to function keys and the numeric keypad. If you define a shortcut using "modifiers" such as shift or alt then that key can still be used without those modifiers for its usual purpose.<P>

In the listing, global shortcuts appear first (before normal ones) and start with the word "Global". They show the keystroke with its modifiers (such as "shift" etc) naturally, and they can also have additional modifiers listed. When you type keystrokes into the "Type a key here" box it reports what it sees, in the same way, so you can find out what is going on.<P>



The additional modifier you might see on Windows is: "Windows", meaning the key with the Windows logo on it. This means that you can use this modifiers for global shortcuts even though it can't be used for normal shortcuts.<P>


Transcribe!'s global shortcuts "bypass" other applications, and they also bypass Transcribe!'s "Audio Effects and Controls" and "Sound File Info" windows (Transcribe!'s normal shortcuts stop working when one of those windows is in front). Transcribe!'s global shortcuts even "bypass" Transcribe!'s normal shortcuts! In other words you can define normal and global shortcuts for the same keystroke but there isn't much point as the global one would take precedence.<P>

Unfortunately Windows' global shortcut handling does not include notification of key releases. You can still program a global shortcut to have both press and release commands, but they will both happen as soon as you press the key. So if you want global shortcuts for Cue &amp; Review (for instance) then you can't make them work like the normal 'c' and 'r' shortcuts. You will need to program two global keys to start Cue and Review, and a third key to end Cue or Review with the PlayPauseOn command.<p>

<HR>
<H3>Export and Import Keyboard Shortcuts</H3>

These commands allow you to export your current keyboard shortcut list to a text file and subsequently import it again. The file created contains two versions of the list. First a machine-readable version which is the part that would be read by the Import command, then a human-readable version which is ignored by the Import command but which may be useful to you if you want to print out a list of your shortcuts for reference.<P>

If unusual characters appear when you load this file into a text editor then you may need to tell the editor to load as UTF8 since that's how it's saved.<P>

Importing is particularly useful if you are running Transcribe! on more than one computer. Having created a collection of shortcuts on one computer you can transfer that list by export and import, rather than having to re-create it. This works between different OS's (Windows / Mac / Linux) but be aware that commmands using the Control key on Windows or Linux will be understood as using the Command key on Mac, and vice-versa.<P>

Also be aware that if you transfer shortcuts between two different species of computer then global shortcuts will probably not work as they are tied to the hardware of the keyboard. You will probably need to delete the imported global shortcuts and recreate them appropriately for the new machine.<P>
