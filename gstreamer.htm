GStreamer is an open source library for handling audio and video media on Windows, Mac and Linux.<P>

Starting with version 8.60, Transcribe! uses GStreamer for all video handling on Windows, Mac, and Linux.<P>



On Windows, GStreamer is optional. Transcribe! runs perfectly well without it, however installing GStreamer will enable you to display videos, read some sound files that cannot be read without it, and export audio in compressed formats such as m4a.<P>
Transcribe! has its own native readers for various sound file formats. If these are not able to open the file then it will use GStreamer if present and if this also fails then it will use "Windows Media Foundation" (which is part of Windows).<P>
