<H3>Installing Transcribe!</H3>
If you are reading this then you probably already have installed it. But for completeness : Transcribe! for Windows is distributed as a self-installing executable (built with the very wonderful Inno Setup). Run the file (double click it) to install Transcribe!, and follow the instructions which appear.<P>

If you want to back up Transcribe! then you should save the downloaded installation file. Other than that, there is no need to keep the downloaded file once Transcribe! is installed.<P>

<H3>If You Want To Uninstall Transcribe!</H3>
"Start Menu" - "Settings" (the Gear icon) - "Apps". You can also use Control Panel if you prefer.<P>
