The Audio Effects and Controls window is one of the most important features of Transcribe!. If it is not currently shown then you can make it apppear by pressing the "Fx" button on the toolbar. There is also a menu item for "Audio Effects and Controls" on the "Window" menu.<P>

If you have multiple transcriptions open at the same time then there will still only be one Audio Effects and Controls window, and it will operate on whichever transcription is currently active (in front of other transcription windows).<P>

This window has six tabbed pages for controlling various aspects of playback. There are some features which are common to all of them.<P>
<UL>
<LI>The "tab" at the top of the page showing the name of the page. Click on this to select the page. If this page is currently active and affecting the sound then a "bullet" appears before the name.
<LI>"Clear" button. This sets the controls on this page to a "do nothing" state.
<LI>"Active/Bypass" radio buttons. Select whether the effects on this page should be applied.
<LI>"Apply to all views of this transcription" checkbox. This only appears if you have multiple views of the current transcription (having used the "Split" command on the View menu). The point is, your reason for having multiple views might be (for instance) so that you can have one of them with some EQ set, the other without. In that case, make sure this checkbox is <I>not</I> checked on the EQ page. On the other hand if you make a tuning adjustment then you might well want that to affect both views the same, so check this checkbox on the Tuning page.
</UL><P>

Two exceptions are the Volume and Clicks controls on the "Misc" page. These are always active and always apply only to the current view.<P>

While you are working in this window, Transcribe!'s keyboard shortcuts won't work because keystrokes are being used by the controls in the window (for instance the arrow keys can adjust sliders, digits can be typed into edit boxes etc). All you have to do, though, is press the Escape key which will take you back to the transcription window where shortcuts have their usual effect. For convenience, the spacebar is also an exception and will have its usual effect as a shortcut, as well as bringing the transcription window to the front.<P>

These are the six pages. Click on them for more information.<P>

<H3><A HREF="fx_mix.htm">Mono/Karaoke</A></H3>
<UL><LI>This is for selecting whether to play in normal stereo, or to select a different mix of channels, including "karaoke" mode.<P></UL>

<H3><A HREF="fx_eq.htm">EQ</A></H3>
<UL><LI>31 band graphic equaliser.<P></UL>

<H3><A HREF="fx_tuning.htm">Tuning</A></H3>
<UL><LI>Adjustment of tuning (pitch). Also generation of reference pitch notes.<P></UL>

<H3><A HREF="fx_transposition.htm">Transposition</A></H3>
<UL><LI>Special handling for transposing instruments, and out-of-tune instruments.<P></UL>

<H3><A HREF="fx_speed.htm">Speed</A></H3>
<UL><LI>Adjustment of speed.<P></UL>

<H3><A HREF="fx_misc.htm">Misc</A></H3>
<UL><LI>Adjustment of volume and clicks (metronome clicks at marker positions).
Also navigation controls, including storing and recalling of loops.<P></UL><P>

The waveform profile display is unaffected by these controls : it always displays the original sound file data. However these controls <I>do</I> affect the spectrum display in an appropriate way corresponding to what you are hearing.<P>

Effects are applied in the same order as the pages appear. So if you set an EQ with a peak at 1kHz and then use the Tuning page to raise the pitch by an octave, the EQ peak will be at 2kHz in the final result.<p>
