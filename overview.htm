The Transcribe! application is an assistant for people who sometimes want to work out a piece of music from a recording, in order to write it out or play it themselves. Transcribe! is also used by many people for play-along practice, and also for speech transcription.<P>

The usual technique for transcribing music is to listen repeatedly to each bit, using your ear and your brain to work out what is happening. Unless you have perfect pitch then you also need a piano or a guitar handy to check which note is which.<P>

However, conventional music players (whether hardware such as a CD player or an iPod, or software such as YouTube, Spotify, or iTunes) are really designed for people who want to listen to whole tracks. They are very inconvenient for transcribing music as they are not designed for this purpose.<P>

Transcribe! does not fundamentally change the process of listening and working it out, but it provides help to make it easier and quicker. The music is presented as a scrolling waveform display, you can place markers for sections, measures and beats and give those markers names so you always know where you are. The playback interface is flexible and responsive - for instance you can change loop points, playback speed, pitch etc while playback continues. The "navigation bar" gives an overall picture of the piece and the markers you have placed. You can click on it to jump to any point immediately. Multiple loops can be saved and recalled. There are many commands related to selection and playback, and you can control them from fully configurable keyboard shortcuts. You can use various kinds of pedals to control playback if you want, allowing hands-free operation - start & stop playback with your feet. You can configure "global shortcuts" - that is, keyboard shortcuts which work even when Transcribe! is not the active application. So you could be using a music notation package to write your transcription, while still being able to control Transcribe! for playback using the keyboard (or indeed pedals, if you have any).<P>

It is important to understand that Transcribe! does not attempt to do the transcribing for you,
processing an audio file and outputting musical notation or MIDI - this would be nice,
but is a currently unsolved research problem for polyphonic music. Transcribe! cannot
work out where the beat is, and although the spectrum analysis feature is very useful
for working out those hard-to-hear chords, you must still use your ear and brain to
decide which of the peaks in the spectrum are notes being played, which are merely
harmonics, and which are just the result of noise and broad-spectrum instruments such
as drums. If you have never worked out even a simple piece of music by ear then
Transcribe! will probably not help you, but if you do sometimes work out recorded
music by ear then Transcribe! can make the job a lot quicker and easier.<P>

Transcribe! takes no interest in MIDI files - these already contain explicit
information about what notes are to be played and when, and there are plenty of
programs available which can display this information. Transcribe! deals with audio
sample data files, referred to here as "sound files".<P>

Transcribe! is not an editor. It records, reads and plays sound files but does
not modify them. It can also export modified sound files (e.g. with pitch or speed change applied) although this is not its primary purpose.<P>
