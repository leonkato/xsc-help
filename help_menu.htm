<H3>Transcribe! Help</H3>
This brings up the Contents page of Transcribe!'s Help.<P>



<H3>FAQ (Seventh String website)</H3>
This will launch your default web browser and take you to the FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) page on the Seventh String website.
This is a very useful resource for any kind of Transcribe! question, and it may contain more up-to-date information than the Help does.<P>


<H3>Check for Updates...</H3>
This will tell you what version of Transcribe! you are running, and then launch your default web browser and take you to the Download page on the Seventh String website, where you can check what is the latest version available.


<H3>System Info</H3>
This displays version and other information about Transcribe! itself and the computer it is running on. Also the text of recent error messages, and other messages not necessarily errors. See <A HREF="trouble.htm">Troubleshooting</A> for why you might want this.<P>


<H3>License Info</H3>
This displays information about your "license key", and allows you to enter a key if you have bought Transcribe! and so have obtained a license key from Seventh String. It's exactly the same dialog as comes up when you launch Transcribe!, if you don't have a license key. <A HREF="buying.htm">Click here</A> for more about this.<P>
