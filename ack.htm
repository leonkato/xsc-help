<H3>Thanks</H3>

Transcribe! uses the very wonderful open source wxWidgets cross-platform application framework. So, many yottabytes of thanks to its developers : Julian Smart who invented it, and the other main authors who are listed on the web site at http://www.wxwidgets.org/about/team/  The wxWidgets home page is http://www.wxwidgets.org/<P>

Transcribe! also uses the GStreamer media handling library - in fact has used it for many years on Linux but now also uses it on Windows and Mac, if it is installed, for handling video and additional sound file formats. A big thank you to all the GStreamer developers. The GStreamer home page is https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/<P>

Many thanks to Imperial College, London for letting me use their wonderful
technical libraries, and to the helpful people who work there.<P>
