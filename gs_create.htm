If you used the "Record new sound file" commands then it will have offered to open a new transcription for you, of the newly created sound file. Otherwise you need to tell Transcribe! to open the sound file. You can drag-n-drop the sound file from your file browser onto Transcribe!'s window, or you can use Transcribe!'s <A HREF="file_menu.htm#open">Open</A> command. Remember to tell the Open command to open "Sound files" (rather than "Transcription files").<P>

When you <A HREF="file_menu.htm#save">Save</A> this transcription Transcribe! will save a "Transcription file" (named *.xsc) which is a small text file containing the name of the sound file and other information about this transcription such as markers you have placed, EQ settings, tuning adjustments etc. Subsequently you would load the transcription file to continue work. The only time you open a sound file directly is when you are starting a new transcription. This can cause confusion so if it's not clear to you, you should read the longer discussion you will find <A HREF="file_menu.htm">here</A>.<P>

Once you have loaded a sound file, its waveform profile should appear in Transcribe!'s window and it should look something like the picture on the next page (not all the features shown necessarily appear, since you can choose which things you want to see with Preferences, View menu, etc).<P>

You should now be able to play the sound file by pressing the Play button on the toolbar. See <A HREF="trouble.htm">Troubleshooting</A> if it doesn't work.<P>

At this point it's a good idea to <A HREF="file_menu.htm#save">Save</A> the transcription you have just created, choosing a suitable location and name for it. Transcribe! will initially make up a name based on the sound file name but you can change it if you want. Personally I tend to put the transcription (xsc) file in the same folder as the sound file which it uses but you don't have to. Once you have created a transcription file on your hard disk, Transcribe! will be able to load it automatically next time you launch Transcribe! (if you set the appropriate option in Preferences), and it will also appear in the Recent Files list.<P>
