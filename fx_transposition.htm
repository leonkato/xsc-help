Transposition does not affect the sound of the track being played at all, instead it has to do with the choice of reference pitch : what pitch would you like to call "A"? Transposition affects the notes played by Transcribe!'s piano keyboard and tuning reference notes, and the spectrum display. If you don't use Transcribe!'s piano, spectrum, or tuning reference notes then you don't need this feature at all.<P>

At standard concert pitch, non-transposing, "A" is 440Hz and if you don't set a transposition then that's what Transcribe! works with. But there are sometimes reasons why you might want to call some other pitch "A". These reasons all have to do with wanting to play the music on an instrument which does not play "A" as 440Hz, or playing a track which was recorded with "A" not at 440Hz. If you only ever work with instruments and tracks where "A" always means 440Hz then you don't need this feature at all.<P>

<UL>
<LI>Suppose you want to play along on a piano whose tuning has slipped a quarter tone flat over the years. First you should use the Tuning page of the Fx window to adjust playback to put the track in tune with your piano. But then, Transcribe!'s piano keyboard and tuning reference notes will still play notes based on A=440, which will be horribly out of tune with the track and your piano. And if you get Transcribe! to display the spectrum of the note which you want to call "A" then it will appear a quarter tone below A on Transcribe!'s piano keyboard. By setting a quarter tone transposition, you can make Transcribe!'s piano, reference notes, and spectrum work with the same pitches that your out-of-tune piano does.<BR>

<LI>Suppose you are transcribing a solo for Bb trumpet. You want to write it out (and maybe play along too) on the basis that the note you are calling "C" is really Bb concert. Set a whole tone transposition and Transcribe! will agree with you about this. This has nothing to do with adjusting the pitch of the track : if the track is in tune and so is your trumpet then you don't need to touch the tuning controls, it's just a question of the naming of the notes used by Transcribe!'s piano, reference notes and spectrum.<BR>

<LI>Suppose you are transcribing something that was recorded using "original instruments" (reproductions really) from the time of Bach. Those instruments will be playing "A" about a semitone below modern pitch. Of course you could use Transcribe!'s Tuning controls to adjust the playback pitch to A=440, but if you prefer to keep the track at its original pitch then you could set a transposition to make Transcribe!'s piano, reference notes, and spectrum work with the same pitches that the track does.<BR>

<LI>Guitar with capo is often best thought of as a transposing instrument. Put a capo on 3 and play a C chord (I mean, play the same chord shape you would ordinarily think of as C). The chord that comes out is really Eb concert, because of the capo. But you would probably prefer to call it C and if you set a transposition of 3 semitones then Transcribe! will agree with this designation.
</UL><P>

There are some preset buttons provided to set appropriate transpositions for some common transposing instruments. These will set the octaves and semitones but will leave the cents unchanged.<P>

If you are using the spectrum then you can also adjust transposition by shift-right-click on the spectrum and drag it left or right.<P>

It may seem a little odd to put out-of-tune instruments together with transposing instruments, but really they are the same in the sense that they are all instruments which, when you play the note called "A", do not play a pitch of 440Hz.<P>

Because of the possibilities for confusion, Transcribe! places reminder messages when there is a transposition in effect : in the "Reference note" section of the Tuning page, and in the upper left corner of the piano itself.<P>
