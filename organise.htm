Most of us would be working on just one or two transcriptions at a time so we have no particular problem organising our work. However some people have many transcriptions on the go, and want to categorise and organise them. For instance a teacher who is teaching students to transcribe, and who wants to be able to locate each student's transcriptions easily when they come for a lesson. Or a professional speech transcriber who will want to organise transcriptions according to who they are for, and by priority. Transcribe! does not have any special features for this, but here I will describe a way of working which you may find quite practical nevertheless.<p>

First, read the discussion <A HREF="file_menu.htm">on this page</A> about transcription files (xsc) and sound files (mp3, wav, m4a etc). To understand the rest of this page, it's essential to have a clear understanding of this.  Some particular points to bear in mind are:<br>
<ul>
<li>Sound files are large. It's not usually a good idea to move them around to different folders because (1) this may cause the software you used to import them (iTunes, Windows Media Player etc) to lose track of them, (2) if you copy them instead then this is wasteful of disk space, and (3) Transcribe!'s transcription files specify the location of the sound file, so Transcribe! will also lose track of them if you move them.
<li>Transcription files are small and can safely be renamed and moved or copied from one folder to another, as long as the transcription is not open in Transcribe! at the time.
<li>It's perfectly ok to have multiple transcription files all referring to the same sound file.
</ul><P>

<H3>So, here are my suggestions...</H3><p>

<b>Sound files:</b> Allow these to reside wherever is convenient and don't move them. If you are using other software to import sound files then let it place them where it wants to.<p>

<b>Transcription files:</b> These are the key to whole business, the idea is to create a transcription file (using Transcribe!'s Save command) for each transcription, and to organise the transcription files by placing them in folders which you create. So all transcriptions in a certain category are found together in one appropriately named folder.<p>

<b>Comments:</b> When you first create a transcription file it may be useful to add a comment to it to remind you of any specal requirements or whatever. The best place for this is in a text block at the beginning of the track. But also you can give a transcription file any name you want - it doesn't have to be the same name as the sound file it refers to. So you could for instance add the word "URGENT" at the front of the transcription file name. It's ok to rename transcription files any time, as long as the transcription is not open in Transcribe! at the time.<p>

<b>Loading files:</b> Working this way, you can use Windows Explorer to locate the folder with the transcription files you are interested in, then load those files by drag-n-drop onto Transcribe!'s window. You can drag-n-drop multiple files at once, of course.<p>

<b>Using Color:</b> The Mac will allow you to color the transcription files in Finder, so you can use a color scheme to indicate which are urgent, which are finished, etc. I don't think Windows has this feature?<p>

<b>Scenario 1: you are teaching students to transcribe:</b> In this case you create a folder for each student, and for each transcription that student is working on you create (using Transcribe!'s Save command) a transcription file in that student's folder. When that student arrives for a lesson, you can easily locate their transcriptions by looking in that folder. If you have several students working on the same track then they will each have their own transcription file though all will refer to the same sound file. This is not wasteful because transcription files are small.<p>

<b>Scenario 2: you receive transcription work from multiple clients:</b> This is quite similar to scenario 1 above, you would create a folder for each client. You might want additional categories - for instance a client's folder might have subfolders called "Urgent" and "Completed". When a transcription is completed you would close its window in Transcribe! and move the transcription file to the "Completed" folder. You would not move the sound files, except ultimately to delete them.<p>

<b>Scenario 3: you are using Transcribe! for play-along practice of a set list:</b> Transcribe! does not have a true "Set List" feature but once again, you can put the relevant transcription files for the set in a folder and then load them all at once very easily with drag-n-drop. If a tune appears in more than one set then it's fine to copy the transcription file - transcription files are small.<p>
