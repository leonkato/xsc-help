Although Transcribe! is primarily intended for transcribing music, many people also use it for
play-along practice. Here are some notes about features you may find useful for
this purpose.<p>

If you press the Fx button to bring up the Fx window, then you can adjust the tuning of the track to match your instrument. You can also change the key up or down in semitones - practice in all keys.<p>

You can set the speed to a slower speed to begin with. Then select any part of the track (sweep the mouse over the waveform) to loop it. In the Fx window, you can play at any speed you want from 5% (one twentieth speed) to 200% (double speed).<p>

It's a good idea to place markers on the measures and sections you want to work on. Then you may find it useful to loop a section between two markers. There are some tips in the FAQ on the website for setting the selection to begin and end exactly on a marker, see https://www.seventhstring.com/xscribe/faq.html<p>

Stored loops enable you to save and recall as many loops or positions as you like, for easy access to the sections you want to concentrate on. See the Misc page of the Audio Effects and Controls window.<p>

Keyboard shortcuts can be very useful - for instance you could configure a shortcut so that you can recall a specific stored loop with a single keystroke. See the File menu.<p>

You may find pedals useful because with these, you can control playback with your feet, without having to let go of your instrument. See the File menu.<p>

And if you're feeling really advanced then check out <A HREF="automation.htm">Automation (Scripts)</A> which allow you program a playlist with speed changes, key changes, etc, which will then run automatically.<p>

And here is a question from the FAQ on the Seventh String website:<br>
"How can I play my electric guitar or keyboard through the computer, for playing along with Transcribe! ?"<br>
Transcribe! itself doesn't do this but it shouldn't be a problem, you just need to use other software for playing your instrument through the computer, and have that software running at the same time as Transcribe!. If you search for "play guitar through computer" (without the quotes) then you will find lots of solutions.<p>
