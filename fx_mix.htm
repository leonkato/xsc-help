Most of the time you will probably want to listen in normal stereo, in which case it's appropriate to "bypass" this page. However you may sometimes want to listen to one channel on its own, or mix them in some different proportion, in which case this page allows you to do that. This isn't like the "balance" control on a stereo : when this page is active you will be hearing exactly the same thing on both playback channels. The controls allow you to decide how much of each of the original two channels should appear in this mix.<P>

If the sound file you are playing is mono then the controls on this page will be disabled.<P>

A popular use for this is what has become known as "karaoke" mode, which means out-of-phase mixing of the two channels so that some parts of the recording cancel out. You may then be able to adjust the mix slider to achieve maximum cancellation of whatever you don't want to hear (perhaps a vocal) while still hearing the accompaniment. How successful this can be depends on how it was recorded.<P>

If the recording was originally mono (e.g. copied from an old vinyl mono
recording) then it won't be effective at all. Instruments that were recorded in
true stereo (using two microphones - pianos are often recorded this way) won't
cancel out very much while instruments recorded on a single mic (such as vocals)
and then placed in the mix by panning will cancel. Therefore it is sometimes
possible to cancel out a vocal while leaving the piano audible, which is useful.
Reverb is usually true stereo so it won't cancel.<P>

Another useful technique for "karaoke" effects is <A HREF="fx_eq.htm">EQ filtering</A>.<p>
