<H3>1. What Does it Mean to Transcribe Music?</H3>

What I am talking about here is the process of working out 
how to play and/or write out a piece of music starting with just a recording 
of the piece - a commercially released CD perhaps. We would usually be 
talking about non-classical music as most classical music can be obtained 
as printed music.<P>

You will also hear classical musicians speak of &quot;transcribing&quot; 
    to mean adapting a piece of music written for one instrument to be played 
    on another. So when John Williams plays Scarlatti sonatas (originally 
    written for keyboard) on the guitar, these would be called &quot;transcriptions&quot; 
    although he didn't need to work them out from a recording because you 
    can buy the published sheet music (for keyboard) in a shop. Non-classical 
    musicians don't often use the word this way because they customarily rearrange 
    music for their own combination of instruments all the time anyway.<P>

The effort involved in transcribing music from recordings 
    varies enormously depending on the complexity of the music, how good you 
    ear is and how detailed you want your transcription to be. If you merely 
    want to write down the chords to a very simple song then if your ear is 
    good you may be able to scribble them down in real time while the music 
    is playing. At the other extreme if you are attempting a detailed transcription 
    of complex music then it can take hours to transcribe a single minute 
    of music.<P>

By the way, &quot;the dots&quot; is an abbreviation meaning 
    the written-out music, because of the visual appearance of written music 
    as dots on a stave.<P>

<H3>2. Why Transcribe Music?</H3>

  <ul>
    <li>Because you want to play a tune but you don't have the dots for it, 
      you only have a recording. Of course you might start by looking for 
      the dots (if it's a jazz tune try the Fake Book Index at
	https://www.seventhstring.com/fbindex.html)
	but if you can't find them what are you going to do? 
      Also, even if you can find the dots they will often be a disappointment 
      when compared to the version you've been listening to and enjoying. 
      Good players will usually make more out of a piece than the standard 
      published dots will show, so you will have to listen to the recording 
      to find out what they're doing. I'm talking about reharmonisation, embellishing 
      chords, added figures and riffs, good bass-line movement, voice leading, 
      etc.
    <li>Jazz musicians regard transcribing as an important educational method. 
      Jazz has a strong emphasis on listening and improvising. Transcribing 
      other people's improvised solos is good for improving your ear and also 
      for gaining insight into the musical ideas they use.
    <li>There are also quite a number of professional transcribers around. 
      For instance, if you buy the sheet music for a popular song then this 
      music will often have been transcribed from the record by a professional 
      who works for the publisher.
  </ul><P>

<H3>3. Prerequisites</H3>
As far as your own musicianship is concerned we could say 
    that there is only one prerequisite which is the ability to tell whether 
    your transcription is right or wrong when you play it and compare it to 
    the original. The extent to which you really can't tell is the extent 
    of possible inaccuracy in your transcription. As long as you <i>can</i> 
    tell, you can keep working at it until your transcription sounds right. 
    How long this takes depends on your ear. If you are having difficulty 
    figuring out the chords then it might be they are too complex for you. 
    Don't despair however. Some people seem to develop a good ear very quickly 
    but I think most people can develop a good ear in time as long as they 
    keep working at it. I think that it's very important to play a chordal 
    instrument (piano or guitar) in order to understand chords and recognise 
    their sound. When I was starting out, a 7#9 chord sounded to 
    me like a pleasantly scrunchy sound but I wouldn't have a clue what the 
    chord was. After a few years playing the guitar and using such chords, 
    an association develops in the mind between playing a 7#9 and the particular 
    flavour of the sound that comes out. Now when I hear someone play a 7#9 
    I recognise it immediately as an old friend. I think that almost anyone 
    can learn this kind of familiarity with chords but for most of us it doesn't 
    happen by magic and it doesn't happen overnight, it's the result of years 
    of playing, practicing, listening and indeed transcribing.<P>

Familiarity with the musical style is one of the biggest 
    factors in making it easy to transcribe. If you have played lots of music 
    in the same style as the piece you're transcribing then you'll find it 
    much easier to understand what they're doing. An anecdote : when I was 
    about 15 and knew almost nothing I tried to transcribe Charles Mingus's 
    &quot;Jelly Roll&quot; from the album &quot;Ah Um&quot;. Listening to 
    it now it's perfectly obvious that it's a blues (14 bar as far as I remember) 
    but I didn't know that then. I listened hard to what the piano player 
    does, thinking that would tell me what the chords are. What I didn't know 
    is that in this kind of music, jazz piano players typically play all sorts 
    of notes with the right hand which don't obviously belong to the chord. 
    If the basic harmony at some particular point is, say, C7 then almost 
    any note except B can be used to construct a harmony which might work 
    in this style. If you don't understand this then trying to work out the 
    chords from the pianist's right hand is a recipe for disaster (I should 
    have started with the bass line). My final result had the melody correct 
    but the chord symbols I came up with were totally wrong and unusable. 
    I'm not suggesting that it was wasted effort though. You have to accept 
    that your first efforts will be of doubtful value but we all have to start 
    somewhere and if you persevere you will improve.<P>

As far as equipment is concerned, obviously you need a means 
    of playing the recording to listen to it. Some ways are easier than others 
    for the purpose of transcribing and every transcriber has their own favourite 
    way of working. Here are my views.<P>

  <ul>
    <li>Vinyl<br>
      This was the only option back in the stone age. No &quot;loop&quot; 
      facility, very difficult to play from a specific point in the piece 
      and a steady hand needed for lifting the needle and putting it back 
      down again without damaging the record. This was transcribing for heroes. 
      On the other hand if you had a player with 16 RPM speed you could slow 
      the music down for the fiddly bits. Some players (the Garrard 401 for 
      instance) allowed fine control over the speed, useful for tuning adjustment.<BR>

    <li>Cassette<br>
      I considered this to be a big step forward, and used a Walkman quite 
      heavily for the purpose. Advantages : portability, the tape counter 
      which although inaccurate does give some idea of where you are, and 
      the easier start/stop/rewind controls. You could listen to the same 
      bit again by briefly pressing the rewind button while in play mode which 
      was very handy. Slow down was no longer possible but if I really needed 
      it I would copy to my two-speed reel-to-reel machine then copy back 
      to cassette at half speed so my cassette tape would then have two versions, 
      one of them full speed and the other half speed.<BR>

    <li>CD/MiniDisc<br>
      Finally the digit was discovered (in the Peruvian jungle at the far 
      end of the Andes) and tamed. These devices give accurate timing indication 
      for the first time so you really can find any given point reliably. 
      The more expensive models will also loop and some even permit tuning 
      adjustment and speed adjustment. If you choose the right model then 
      these are excellent transcription tools.<BR>

    <li>Computer Software - Transcriber's Assistants<br>
      These days pretty much all desktop computers are capable of recording 
      and playing audio and there are various computer based player programs 
      intended to help you transcribe music. Transcribe! from Seventh 
      String Software is of course the best!<br>
      The features offered by such programs are limited only by the imagination 
      of the program designer (and of course by what is technically possible). 
      It is usual to be able to set multiple loop points, adjust tuning and 
      slow down the music without pitch change. Transcribe! can also analyse
      the sound and will attempt to guess the notes being played, and indeed
      the chords too. On some kinds of material this can be very useful.<BR>

    <li>Computer Software - Automatic Transcription<br>
      The most ambitious programs attempt to actually do the transcribing 
      for you, processing an audio file and outputting MIDI or musical notation. 
      I admire their courage in making the attempt, but my impression is that 
      they are not really all that useful. On music where multiple notes are 
      being played at the same time by multiple instruments (i.e. almost all 
      music!) they make so many mistakes that it's difficult to see them as 
      useful for serious purposes. We will not discuss them further in this document.
  </ul><P>

This document is a discussion of how to transcribe music regardless of 
    what device you use for playing the music on.<P>

<H3>4. Transcribing</H3>

First try to get hold of the dots! Some people will tell 
    you you shouldn't because transcribing is &quot;good for you&quot;. I 
    certainly agree that transcribing is good for you but if you are at all 
    active musically then there will always be things you want to play for 
    which you can't get the dots, so I think you should save your transcribing 
    time and energy for those. Also, as I mentioned above, if you are listening 
    to a recording you like then the chances are that the sheet music will 
    not show the nice things the musicians are doing which make the recording 
    special. So you will still end up doing some transcribing, but the dots 
    may help as a starting point.<P>

Map out the structure of the piece - verse, chorus, middle 
    section and so on. Even if you don't intend to transcribe the whole thing 
    it's often useful to have a complete map because if the chords are unclear 
    to you at some point then if you know that the same thing happens elsewhere 
    in the piece then you could listen to it there - it may be clearer second 
    time. So listen through the whole thing making a note of what happens 
    where. For instance if you're using a CD player then you could list the 
    sections on a piece of paper with the start time of each section taken 
    from the CD player's display so you can find it again. On Transcribe!,
	you would place markers.<P>

If necessary then adjust the tuning of the playback to match 
    your instrument. If the playback device you are using does not permit 
    this then you may instead be able to adjust the tuning of your instrument 
    to match the piece. By the way, some people recommend transcribing without 
    any instrument in your hands, by the use of pure ear-power. That's great 
    if you can do it but this document is aimed at less experienced transcribers. 
    I would recommend having a guitar or keyboard handy and constantly checking 
    your transcription by playing along and asking yourself if it sounds right.<P>

Now it's time to start transcribing. This is rather like 
    doing a jigsaw. When you do a jigsaw you start with the easy bits. Once 
    enough of these are done then you can hope that the hard bits will fall 
    into place. In the same way, start your transcription with the things 
    you can hear easily. That usually means any prominent single-note instrument 
    (including vocal). Hearing the inner voices of a chord is hard so don't 
    start with that. Start with the melody. Loop it a phrase at a time and 
    play along until you find the notes. Write them down and move on. Then 
    tackle the bass part. If it is murky or unclear then try raising its pitch 
    - Transcribe! will allow you to raise the pitch by 
    an octave without speeding the music up. This can give the bass part much 
    better definition. The bass part is crucial when you come to figure out 
    the chords because bass players frequently play the root of the chord, 
    or else the 3rd or 5th, so knowing the bass part gives huge clues to what 
    the chord is. Also remember that if in doubt you should listen to other 
    points in the piece where the same sequence occurs, to get a second opinion.<P>

Write down any other prominent riffs and backing figures 
    in the same way.<P>

Now start on the harmonies. This is the hardest part so 
    again we pick away at it bit by bit. Pick out whatever single notes you 
    can hear in the chords - often the top note of a chord is easier to distinguish 
    so write down whatever notes you can hear in any of the chords. Often 
    &quot;voice leading&quot; is used in harmony - this is where you hear 
    a prominent note (a &quot;voice&quot;, but not necessarily vocal - could 
    be any instrument) in the harmony, which moves to the next note above 
    or below or stays the same when the chord changes. These are usually easy 
    to hear so work them out and write them down. When you've picked out as 
    many specific notes as you can then you try to identify the chords. This 
    is where your experience and your knowledge of the musical style you're 
    dealing with make a big difference. If you are experienced in the style 
    then you will know what kinds of chords and chord progressions are likely. 
    The bass line, melody line and top line of harmony that you have already 
    worked out will narrow the possibilities right down and you can try out 
    the possible chords on your instrument to see what fits. On the other 
    hand if the chord is an altered dominant and you don't know what an altered 
    dominant is then it won't be so easy, though you may still be able to 
    find something that works even if you don't know what to call it. A useful 
    technique to get further clues is to try playing single notes on your 
    instrument, when the chord comes in the track. Try a C, does it fit? C#? 
    D? When you find a note which fits, perhaps it belongs in the chord. Transcribe!'s 
    spectrum analysis feature is also useful here.<P>

The approach just described assumes that your transcription 
    will include chord symbols but of course sometimes you will be aiming 
    for a complete note-for-note transcription of the performance. In this 
    case it's up to you to listen closely for each note! It can still be helpful 
    to think in terms of chords, to help understand what is happening.<P>

Here's a tip (courtesy of Charles Alexander) for determining 
    the correct key that a piece is in. This often causes confusion because 
    although for many pieces the first chord is also the key, there are many 
    pieces where this is not so. You should look instead at the end of the 
    piece. Play up to the end then whistle a &quot;shave and a haircut&quot; 
    ending like this (written here in C major) :
<IMG SRC="shave.png" BORDER="0"><br>
    Whistle it in whatever key sounds right for the piece. The last note of 
    the &quot;shave and a haircut&quot; ending is the key of the piece. This 
    works for major keys. For minor keys I think it's usually true that the 
    starting chord of the melody is the key, unless the title contains the 
    word &quot;Autumn&quot; (Autumn Leaves, Autumn in New York). However just 
    because a piece starts on a minor chord doesn't mean it's in a minor key 
    - for instance &quot;It Don't Mean A Thing&quot; starts on G minor but 
    is in Bb major, as the &quot;shave and a haircut&quot; test reveals.<P>

Here's a tip for determining rhythmic values of fast notes. 
    Suppose someone plays two notes quite quickly, &quot;duh-duh&quot; and 
    you're asking yourself are they eighth notes? Sixteenths? Part of a triplet? 
    The answer is to tap your hand in time with the quarter-note pulse of 
    the piece and sing along with the &quot;duh-duh&quot; notes but extend 
    them to an endless sequence at the same speed &quot;duh-duh-duh-duh...&quot;. 
    Then all you have to do is count how many fit into a quarter note. Two? 
    then they're eighth notes. Six? then they're triplet sixteenths. For more 
    complicated phrases learn the phrase so you can sing it accurately, then 
    sing it on your own with your hand tapping the beat (switch off playback) 
    then get slower and subdivide the beat by tapping your hand more rapidly. 
    When you subdivide the beat into small enough pieces then you will find 
    every note of the phrase will be on one of the subdivisions so by noting 
    how many subdivisions per quarter note you are tapping and which subdivision 
    each note falls on, you can work out the rhythm.<P>

Finally, here's a heretical suggestion. If the purpose of 
    your transcription is to perform the piece yourself then remember that 
    it isn't necessary for your transcription to be totally accurate. If there's 
    something complicated going on and you just can't figure it out, remember 
    that it's always an option to just make up something else to play at that 
    point. As long as it sounds good, who's going to complain? You may even get praised for your "creative reharmonisation".
