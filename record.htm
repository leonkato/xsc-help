This command is a straightforward recording facility, where you feed sound into your
computer either from a microphone or (more likely) an audio cable from your CD or cassette
player or directly from the machine's built-in CD player, and use this command to record
the result to disk as a sound file suitable for transcription.<P>

You can also use this command for capturing output from other programs on your computer. That is, if you want to capture the audio from a YouTube video or from some proprietary sound player then there might be a clever way of downloading or converting the file, but a quick and simple technique is to plug a lead from the headphone output to the line or mic input, and record the sound while it's playing.<p>

If you have an audio CD and your computer has a CD drive then it is better to copy digitally if possible - see <A HREF="gs_obtain.htm">here</A> for instructions.<P>

This command creates WAV or AIFF or compressed format files (mp3 by default).<P>

To export compressed formats, you need to have GStreamer installed (see the <A HREF="gstreamer.htm">GStreamer help page</A>).<p>

See <A HREF="file_menu.htm#prefs_export">Preferences - Export</A> for settings relating to compressed file exporting (e.g. to select the type of file and the quality).<p>

<B>Sound Source</B><P>
<UL>
<LI>Use default device<BR>
Normally the "Use default device" box is checked. However if you have more
than one sound card in your computer then you can uncheck this box, and select
the device to be used for recording from.<BR>

<LI>Sample Rate<BR>
Select 44100 or 22050 Hz.<BR>
<LI>Mono / Stereo<BR>
As it says.<BR>
<LI>Apply These Settings<BR>
If you make changes in the "Sound Source" box then you must press this button to apply them. You will get a status message to the right of the button. You won't necessarily get what you asked for, for instance if the sound card is capable of 22050 sample rate but not 44100.<BR>
</UL>

Apart from the selection of input sound device already mentioned, there is a separate issue which is the question : What sound source should the input device listen to?
Many sound interfaces can receive audio input from a variety of sources which can
include "mic", "line" and perhaps "digital i/o" (these three usually mean mini-jack
connector sockets at the back of the machine) and also perhaps "CD audio" meaning a
direct audio feed (connected internally) from your CDROM drive.<P>

You will need to find the software controls for your sound device, in order to select the
appropriate input source according to where your audio is coming from and set the
volume level (e.g. if you are recording from a cassette machine then you would plug
the signal into the "line" input, and you must then tell the soundcard to receive
from "line"). When the correct source is selected you will see the VU meters on the
Record New Sound File dialog jumping up and down with the dynamics of
the music playing.<P>

Different sound devices have different features, and different software drivers
(provided by the manufacturers) to control them. You may need to consult the
documentation supplied with your machine and sound device to find out how to do this.<P>

On some Windows systems this can be a matter of using "Start Menu" - "Settings" (the gear icon)
- "System" - "Sound". Then select the appropriate input (mic, line, CD)
according to what you want to record, click "Properties" and set the volume level.<P>

If an option is provided for "monitoring the recording input" then you should
select it : this way you will be hearing the same as what you are recording.
If you hear nothing when you select this option then you have not yet set things
up correctly to get the sound feeding into the recording input of the soundcard.<P>

On some systems there may be a separate program for these controls, often called a "Mixer".<P>



<B>File to Record to</B><P>
Here you select the format (WAV or AIFF or Compressed) you want to record, and the name and folder to use for the sound file.<P>

<B>Note:</B> make sure you select (use the Browse button) a folder on a suitable hard disk with plenty of room. For example, Transcribe! cannot record to an audio CD because it is not writable.<P>

<B>Note:</B> it's a good idea to give the sound file a descriptive name before pressing the Record button to start recording. Anyway, make sure that you select a different name from any other sound file you have already recorded. If you select a sound file which already exists then Transcribe! will ask for confirmation before it is overwritten. Don't tell Transcribe! to overwrite it unless you are sure you don't need the old one. If you overwrite a file which Transcribe! already had opened for transcribing, then when you next try to play it Transcribe! will report errors trying to read it.<P>

<B>VU Meters</B><P>
These show the levels Transcribe! is currently "hearing" whether recording or not. Adjust the volume to get a good level without hitting the end.<P>

Here's a useful tip if you are using this command for copying old analogue
recordings to your computer : instead of worrying too much about adjusting
the recording level, keep the level on the low side for safety, so Transcribe!'s "Margin dB"
might be as much as 10dB or 20dB when done. Make a note of what the margin was,
and use the EQ page of the Audio Effects and Controls window to boost the level
by slightly less than that number of dB. Transcribe! will not actually pass the signal
through the EQ processing if you merely use it to adjust level like this (i.e. this
causes no unnecessary signal degradation). Then, when using the "Export Split
Sound File" command, make sure to tick the EQ box so this boost is applied,
and the output files will have good level. You might think you're losing some
dynamic range by doing this but in fact the dynamic range of 16 bit digital
is so enormously greater than old analogue media that you are not losing
anything meaningful.
For another method of determining the maximum signal level in your recording,
see <A HREF="view_menu.htm#show_db">Show dB Lines</A>.<p>


<B>Margin</B><P>
This is so you can see whether your recording level has overloaded, it tells you how much safety margin there was for the loudest sound so far seen. If it says "0" then there may have been an overload.<P>

<B>Time</B><P>
<UL>
<LI>Time available : how much free space on disk. It reports on the disk which contains the folder selected in "File to Record to" (above). It will say "0" if you have selected an unsuitable disk such as an audio CD.
However this time calculation assumes uncompressed WAV or AIFF format. If you are recording to a compressed format
then you will have much more time available than reported here, and this dialog's brain is not big enough to figure it out.<BR>
<LI>Time recorded : as it says.<BR>
<LI>Auto stop : this is useful if want Transcribe! to record unattended, but you don't want it to record forever and fill your hard disk. Use the spin control to select a number of minutes, then check the "Auto stop" box. Transcribe! will stop recording when this many minutes have been recorded.<BR>
</UL>

<B>Record / Stop Recording</B><P>
These start and stop recording, to the file name that you have specified.<P>

If you select a sound file which already exists then Transcribe! will ask for confirmation before it is overwritten. Don't tell Transcribe! to overwrite it unless you are sure you don't need the old one.<P>

When you stop recording, Transcribe! will offer to open a new transcription for the sound file you have recorded.<P>

You can pause and resume while recording. The little light to the right of the button will flash red while recording and green while paused.<P>


<B>If It Doesn't Work</B><P>
By far the most common problem is that you <B>must</B> select the appropriate recording source, or else you
will just record silence. Instructions for doing this are above. Even though the music is playing into the "line" input while you Record, if you have selected "Mic" input for recording then you will record silence.<P>

Are the VU meters jumping up and down while the music plays? If not then Transcribe!
is not "hearing" the sound, probably because the correct source has not been selected.<P>

If the recording is successful but the sound is faint and obscured by a lot of background
noise, then you are probably recording from the internal microphone. Clap your hands to
see if the VU meters respond. It is not a good idea to record from the internal mic as
the quality will be very poor.<P>

As a double-check you could try recording with the Windows program Voice Recorder
(On the Start Menu) to see whether this can "hear" the sound.<P>
