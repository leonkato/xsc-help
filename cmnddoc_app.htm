<center><h3>Commands that require parameters, which can only be used for <A HREF="automation.htm">Automation</A>.</h3></center><p>

<b>ScriptWait(double)</b>: Causes your script file to wait before executing the next command.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parameter: how many seconds to wait.<br>
This is intended to make it possible to play (or wait silently) in a script file. You would issue a Play command to start playback, then wait. If you are playing and you specify a waiting time of zero then it will wait until playback stops, so you should switch off Loop mode first! (of course you can always stop it by manual control with the mouse). This counts real seconds not sound file seconds, which would be different if speed change is happening.<p>
<b>ScriptWaitLoops(int)</b>: Causes your script file to wait before executing the next command.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parameter: how many loops to wait.<br>
This is intended to make it possible to play and loop in a script file. You would issue a Play command to start playback, then wait. Waiting will end when the specified number of loops have been completed.<p>
<b>ScriptMessage(text)</b>: Displays a message box with Ok and Cancel buttons.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parameter: the text to display in the box.<br>
If you press "Ok" then the script will continue. "Cancel" will stop the script.<p>
<b>VersionCheck(int, int, int)</b>: Checks that the version of Transcribe! is at least what you specify.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parameter 1: the major version number.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parameter 2: the minor version number.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parameter 3: the micro version number.<br>
E.g. (7,51,2) will check for at least version 7.51.2 and stop the script if not.<p>
<b>CreateFile(text, text)</b>: Create a file with the given text content.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parameter 1: the absolute name of the file.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parameter 2: the text content.<br>
This will fail if the file already exists, but you could DeleteFile first if you want to be sure that won't happen. This is intended to allow other programs to know that a job has been done. For instance if you are exporting a large sound file then you could make this the next command. Then another program, on seeing this file appear, will know the sound file export has finished.<p>
<b>DeleteFile(text)</b>: Delete a file.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parameter: the absolute name of the file.<br>
This will not complain if the file doesn't exist. It can be used to make sure that a file doesn't exist before running some other command that will fail if it does. It can also be used for communication with other programs in a similar way to the CreateFile command.<p>
